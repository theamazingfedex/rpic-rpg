# Rpic Rpg
I wanted to make an RPG AI and Event scripting library. I chose python to do this since it has broad support and diverse package availability.

## Contributions
Since the project is still extremely young, most contribution efforts should be focused on adding text-content such as:
* NPC's
  * NPC Welcome Messages - I just interacted with an NPC, what does he say?
  * NPC Idle Messages - What I hear in a crowd of NPC's
  * NPC Radius Messages - I've been standing near this NPC for more than a few seconds, he asks what i'm doing or something.

* Player Text *"Where am I?"* or *"Oh, what's this?"*
  * Initial Interaction - NPCs
  * Initial Interaction - Creatures
  * Initial Interaction - World Items
  * Initial Interaction - Inventory Items

* Quests
  * EventChain Messaging
    1. Trigger (how the quest starts) *(player says something about dogs, and gets asked about quest to find lost dog)*
    2. NPC quest initialize dialog
    3. Text options available at each stage of the quest.
    4. Offering Faction (if applicable) *which group to turn the quest in to*
    5.
